### CY8CKIT-041-41XX BSP
The PSoC™ 4100S Pioneer Kit enables you to evaluate and develop with Cypress's fourth-generation, low-power CAPSENSE™ solution using the PSoC™ 4100S device.

NOTE: BSPs are versioned by family. This means that version 1.2.0 of any BSP in a family (eg: PSoC™ 6) will have the same software maturity level. However, not all updates are necessarily applicable for each BSP in the family so not all version numbers will exist for each board. Additionally, new BSPs may not start at version 1.0.0. In the event of adding a common feature across all BSPs, the libraries are assigned the same version number. For example if BSP_A is at v1.3.0 and BSP_B is at v1.2.0, the event will trigger a version update to v1.4.0 for both BSP_A and BSP_B. This allows the common feature to be tracked in a consistent way.

### What's Included?
The CY8CKIT-041-41XX library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
* cybsp_types.h file describing basic board setup
* Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, and ARM toolchains
* Configurator design files (and generated code) to setup board specific peripherals
* .lib file references for all dependent libraries
* API documentation

### What Changed?
#### v3.0.0
Note: This revision is only compatible with ModusToolbox Tools 3.0 and newer.
* Removed default dependency on HAL and CAPSENSE™ middleware. If either is needed they can be added to the application using the library manager.
* Updated recipe-make, core-make, and PDL to new major versions
* Regenerated code with Configurators from ModusToolbox™ v3.0.0
* Renamed top level board makefile to bsp.mk
* Removed version.xml file in favor of new props.json
#### v2.0.0
* Updated to HAL dependency to v2.0.0
* Updated CAPSENSE™ dependency to v3.0.0
* Regenerated code with Configurators from ModusToolbox™ v2.4.0
#### v1.2.0
* Added SysClk power management callback
* Minor branding updates
#### v1.1.0
* Updated configuration to include power settings
* Minor documentation updates
#### v1.0.0
* Initial production release
#### v0.5.0
* Initial pre-production release
